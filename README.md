# Ghostly
Ghostly is a cute, helpful ghost that lives on your desktop. But it's not like the old assistants. Ghostly is powered by a real AI brain (using Kiro's MCP) and can actually help you with your tasks. It's a friendly spirit, a helpful haunt for your computer, that pops up only when you truly need it.
